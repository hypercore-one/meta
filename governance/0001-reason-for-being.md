# 0001: Reason for Being

## Statement
HyperCore One exists to ensure that the Zenon Network ecosystem can be maintained and improved through open, iterative, and collaborative development.

## Explanation
The founding of HyperCore One was driven by a need to re‑align the development of Zenon Network with the principles of transparency and community collaboration.

We believe that open, iterative, and collaborative development produces superior outcomes and long‑term velocity, while remaining accountable to the community it serves.

Open collaboration throughout the software delivery lifecycle:
- surfaces better ideas,
- enables rigorous review,
- fosters buy‑in and adoption, and
- ensures long‑term maintainability.

We reject opaque contributions that deny others a meaningful opportunity to review, influence, and contribute to the outcome. Such contributions tend to produce brittle, unmaintainable systems, weaken confidence, and concentrate knowledge and control in ways that undermine the ecosystem’s resilience.

HyperCore One provides the structure and leadership needed for contributors who share these values to work together productively.

Our vision is a network ecosystem that sustains itself through open, collaborative development and shared governance — and through our work with Zenon Network and other decentralized protocols, we strive to make this the norm.
